    more doc strings, object input checks, added a sphericalreflection surface class as part of the option, and added a test suite file to test planoconvex lens configurations and lens optimising

    Added doc strings for less straightforward functions, and all classes, and rechose private vs public attributes

    made an object checking method outside of all classes and implemented it in all methods. Also made list of points and directions for a ray hidden attributes

    had a bug with using two sphericalrefracting surfaces in a row - couldn't get a proper refraction pattern, a planoconvex lens wouldn't focus the beam and for some reason the second surface seemed to use a new ray instance rather than the one propagated through the first surface. The problem merely relied in my configuration of the normal vectors, as they pointed different directions. Have parallax trace methods in the ray class for tracing/plotting two rays, and the trace2 method for beam to trace it through two sphericalrefracting surfaces with a plot and spot plot in x-y

    added paralax functions for two rays under the ray class to estimate paralaxial focus, had some trouble with configuring the graphing (for some reason a blank figure of axes range (0,1) would pop up every time i imported the module to the console. Plot function is fairly inefficient and longwinded for parax because of this

    polished up graphing methods, made the beam properly circular and evenly spaced, added method to return ray density of beam

    fixed refract method, added collimated beam class and sorted out graphing

    fixed all bugs, added OutputPlane class, changed intercept method to include aperture radius consideration. Also changed append() method in Ray class to make it so either k or p could be added, not necessarily both at once

    added some methods to help implement the refract method later on, and started the refract method; have yet to implement the production of the resulting direction vector in media II

    file changes, errors with the last commit. Git was tracking the wrong version of the raytracer file. This commit has now added the intercept method for all types of spherical surfaces, including plane surfaces.

    finished intercept method for convex and concave surfaces but not plane surfaces. Had to build 'centre' method to calculate the centre of the spherical surface, a 'surface' method that determines what type of surface it is based on its curvature sign, and a 'radius' method to calculate the radius. I also split up the long l calculation into variables such as 'rdotkunit' and 'r_mag' to make the code easier to read

    finished building the Ray class, had an issue building the intercept method because my maths had an error; the value beneath the square root in calculating l is always negative, perhaps due to an error in translating the spherical coordinates for the optical element's sphere to be centred at the origin
